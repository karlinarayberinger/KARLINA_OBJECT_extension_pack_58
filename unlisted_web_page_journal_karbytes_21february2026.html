<p>I decided that the snapshot of the canon karbytes file collection as it is configured at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 20_FEBRUARY_2026 should be the finalized version of the karbytes version named <strong>karbytes2026_0</strong>.</p>
<p>This note is intended to be incorporated into the karbytes micro-directory named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_karlina_object_extension_pack_58/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_58</a> (in the <strong>karbytes2026_1</strong> version of that (open to future edits) micro-directory (and not in the karbytes2026_0 version of that micro-directory).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff">Both karbytes2026_0 and karbytes2026_1 are encompassed by the two 25-gigabyte M_DISC-sized collections named &#8220;karbytes_origins&#8221; and &#8220;karbytes_nexus&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;karbytes_origins&#8221;</strong> was finalized at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 31_DECEMBER_2025 and is represented as the karbytes snapshot named <strong>karbytes2025_22</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;karbytes_nexus&#8221;</strong> is expected to be finalized at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 31_DECEMBER_2026 and is represented as the karbytes snapshot named <strong>karbytes2026_[N]</strong> (where [N] is a placeholder for some <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">natural number</a> larger than or equal to one (and represented in the snapshot name as a base-ten number (e.g. 1))).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>A time period <strike>spanning at least one week (but no longer than six months)</strike> starting at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 20_FEBRUARY_2026 is expected to temporally separate karbytes2026_0 and karbytes2026_1.</p>
<p>During <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_58/main/journal_karbytes_21february2026_p3.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that &#8220;hiatus period&#8221;</a>, files which are expected to be incorporated into karbytes2026_1 and which are generated during that &#8220;hiatus period&#8221; are expected to be stored in the public GitHub repository named projects owned by the GitHub user named @informationcrystals (and saved to at least two 25-gigabyte M_DISCs (and to the WayBack Machine using URLs listed in a plain-text file in projects named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_58/main/journal_karbytes_21february2026_p4.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">temp.txt</a>.
