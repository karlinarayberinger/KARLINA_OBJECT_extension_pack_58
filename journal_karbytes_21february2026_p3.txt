I decided to redact only the part of the journal entry (whose URL is displayed above this paragraph) which says that the temporal gap between karbytes2026_0 and karbytes2026_1 is no shorter than one week and no longer than six months.

I decided instead to set that temporal gap to no shorter than 3 hours and no longer than 72 hours.
